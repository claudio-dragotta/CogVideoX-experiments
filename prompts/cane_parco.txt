A happy golden retriever dog running and jumping over a wooden agility hurdle in a sunny park. The dog leaps mid-air with all four paws off the ground, ears flying back, tongue out with a joyful expression. Green grass field with scattered autumn leaves, oak trees in the background. Soft golden hour sunlight, shallow depth of field, professional pet photography style, cinematic, 4K.
