A lone samurai warrior standing in heavy rain on an ancient Japanese bridge at night. Cherry blossom petals fall and mix with the rain. The samurai slowly unsheathes his katana, which gleams in the moonlight. Mist rises from the wooden bridge. Traditional Japanese architecture in the background with paper lanterns glowing warmly. Cinematic, dramatic, Kurosawa film style, 4K.
